        <h1>Lerning HTML & CSS</h1>

        <p>Learning HTML and CSS is very fun to learn. One of the best things to be to able to edit or add code and then see it work right away. <br> These can sometimes be challenging to learn, but with enough pratice, it will be well worth it.</p>

        <p>You want to first start out with HTMl. This teaches you the structre of the website. The skeletal structure. <br> This will be the information and sometimes pictures that you will want in your website.</p>

        <p>CSS you will learn second. This will make your website look pretty. Add color to the background and words. Style the images. <br> Use the font you want. And even put things where you want them to be.</p>
