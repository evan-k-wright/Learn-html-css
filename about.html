        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>HTML is very fun to do and learn. But what is HTML? HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. <br> It is the information that is in the website. HTML is the bone structure of the website.</p>

        <p>Like this little lego guy, he has a structure, but he doesn't look very pretty. HTML is that structure.</p>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <p>CSS is where we get into how the webiste looks. The fonts. Colors. How and where the pictures will be. All sorts of stuff like that. <br> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. And that is exactly what you are doing. Styling the Sheet.</p>

        <p>As you can tell, the lego guy looks a lot better then before. That is because we addes color and looks to him. <br> That is what CSS does to your website.</p>
